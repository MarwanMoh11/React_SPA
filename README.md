# Project: Responsive Single-Page Application (SPA)

## 1. Project Overview

This project entails the design, development, and deployment of a modern, responsive Single-Page Application. The primary objective is to build a feature-rich, user-friendly interface that performs efficiently across all devices, serving as a comprehensive demonstration of modern frontend development practices.

## 2. Tech Stack

The application is built from the ground up using a contemporary tech stack:

-   **Framework/Library:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)
-   **API & State Management:** [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/)
-   **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com)

## 3. Core Features and Requirements

-   **UI/UX:** The user interface is crafted using a combination of **Material-UI (MUI)** for its robust component library and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling, resulting in a clean, responsive, and intuitive design.

-   **Component Architecture:** The application is structured using **React functional components** and leverages **React Hooks** for state management and handling side effects, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.

-   **API Integration & State Management:** Data fetching and state management for server-side data is handled efficiently using **React Query**. This includes implementing full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality, ensuring the UI is always synchronized with the backend.

-   **Deployment and Documentation:** The final application will be deployed to a public-facing web service. The entire process, from setup to deployment, is thoroughly documented to provide a clear record of the development lifecycle and architectural decisions.
